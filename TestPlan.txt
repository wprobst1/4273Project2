To test our YOLO model, we checked our model against the test data sets with an assortment of the objects located within them. With a positive identification rate of XX%, we were confident that the model was well-trained enough to be used on various test sources. We also created a test .mp4 file with some spliced together YouTube videos containing the required objects to see the models accuracy in the case of video inputs rather than photos.
